Day 4, Tuesday, May 30th 2017

"O Allah, make me as effective as Frank Underwood without needing any of his tactics! 
Don't let House of Cards or our current political situation make folks believe that one needs to be a jerk to be successful in the "real world". 
Empower us to call out and alleviate existing bs in our systems and organizations.
Enlighten us to create better cultures at home, among friends, and at work."
