# Ramadan Prayers
A repo of ramadan prayers, prompts, and other ideas.

My Ramadan Prayers is a repository of…prayers! After praying a few times this month, I realized how superficial and trite my supplications have been. I felt I needed to be more respectful and thoughtful about them, so I decided to pray for things around a certain theme each day, and spend that day thinking and talking about issues surrounding that theme. After a few days, I felt like sharing my prayers with others. 

The What
This is merely a digital record of personal supplications made during Ramadan, so they can be shared easily with others, and reflect on later! Prayers can range from being very general (made at a public prayer at a mosque led by an Imam) to very personal (made in daily prayers). These need not be limited to Ramadan, though. It started in Ramadan since I tend to pray and think more about prayer during the month. 

The Why
Maybe “open sourcing” prayers can help us be more diligent about them, and invite others into our lives just like other forms of social shares do! Prayers can help prompt and scope thinking, so a collection of them could provide for good, reliable food for thought. From personal experience, much of the prayers tend to be about improvements we want to see in our lives and the lives of loved ones, so sharing them may help draw attention to different areas of personal and familial growth. 

The How
Sharing is caring! Here are some tips / instructions to add your prayer to this public repo. You only need a thoughtful prayer or wish, a computer with notepad, and an internet connection to get started. You can also build on an existing prayer by copying and modifying it.
